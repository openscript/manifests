 # Coding
 Some rules to follow to write better code.
 
 - A place where code was changed, should be left at least as clean as it was found.
 - Copy-pasting creates redundancy, so it shouldn't be used or at least very carefully.
 - Optimization can be done, when performance becomes a problem.
   - `Premature optimization is the root of all evil.` Donald Knuth
 - Verify every step, if the environment feels unknown or shaky.
